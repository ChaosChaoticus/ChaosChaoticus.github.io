                <p><b>Descent Damage Calculator V1.2</b></p>

                <p>Calculates Probabilities to deal damage, roll defence, roll surges and to pass attribute tests.</p>


                <p>Two plots can be drawn:</p>
                <p>1. Absolute Probabilitiy:<br>
                This is the probability to deal exactly X amount of damage(roll shields/surges etc.)</p>
                <p>2. Cummulative probability:<br>
                This is the probability to deal at least x amount of damage(roll shields/surges etc.)</p>


                <p>For the rerolls and set dice, I had to make a few assumptions, lest the program would be quite a bit more complicated.<br>
                1. For the rerolls, they are rolled only if the worst result is rolled. This means:<br>
                  blue: X<br>
                  red: 1 damage<br>
                  yellow: 1 damage<br>
                  green: 1 damage<br>
                  brown/grey/black: blank<br>
                2. For the set dice I am assuming that an ability lets you set the dice if you roll X or blanks or otherwise the worst face. Hence, the worst result is replaced with the best one.<br>
                3. Mark the fact that range is not taken into account for these considerations. Hence, the displayed damage probabilities for long-range attacks would be higher than displayed as X is replaced by the face with range 2.
